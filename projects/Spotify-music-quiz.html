                            The UX/UI challenge, as given by D&AD - Young Blood Awards, was to get listeners to soundtrack and share their life through Spotify. Our team was to build a feature within the app to help people easily share their favourite music and get people talking. And this is how we did it.

                                        Our challenge now was to create a concept that is easy and straightforward when usability is key, but that also acts as a stage for personal stories and expression when inspiration is needed the most. A system that is both Inspirational as well as a Trustworthy.
                                        We solved this challenge by creating two modes; From simple to expressive. This allowed us to dial our designs up and down, still being true to our Creative Direction.

                                    The last step before designing, was to agree on a list all the core elements of the Hubista. This would serve as a 'design toolbox' that includes all the brand elements necessary for a comprehensive design process.

                                    Our commitment to having close communication between the client and our design team ensured that every member of the team was able to see the vision clearly. This meant that everyone brought their own creativity and hard work to the mix, and because of that we were able to dig into the work of creating the different parts of the toolbox quickly and efficiently.

                                    The unification of the strategy, concept, and design that emphasizes the client’s key messages was at the core of this project. It all resulted in a compiled Brand Book for our client - a guide on all aspects of the design, and how the different parts worked together into the final identity.
