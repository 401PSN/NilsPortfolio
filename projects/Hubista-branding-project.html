                                    For this project, we began with extensive research, including question and answer meetings with our client to determine their goals for the project. In addition to gathering valuable information about their mission and strategy, this approach allowed us to identify the product's key areas of improvement in advance of creating the Brand Identity.

                                        Our First Client Meeting Hubista came to us asking for help with the brand identity before going live.                            </figcaption>

                                <p>
                                    We wanted our client to feel involved during this part, and the goal for our was to learn as much as possible of Hubistas core. The business, their world, and the opportunities of the brand.                        
                                </p>
                                </div>

                                    We used a combination of desk research and insights from conversations with people in the target group to narrow down categories of services they wanted to focus on, refining their value proposition, and giving them tasks to further define parts of their business plan.                       
                                    We ended this part of the process by creating a Creative Brief. The intention of it was to fully align on what Hubista is and should be. This in order to build the brand on top of this foundation - always having something to refer to, and back up future design decisions.                                 </p>

                                            The Creative Brief included Background, Audit, Job Story, Opportunity, and Challenges.    
                                         </h6>

                                    We narrowed Hubistaâ€™s target audience by converting all of the personas into to two main groups, Sellers and Buyers. From there, we wrote two job stories for each group.
                                    This allowed us to do less assumptions and more focus on the drivers and the motivation behind our target group.

                                        After reviewing our findings in the initial phase, our team understood that being able to move forward, we needed to position Hubista in the market. Deciding on on how wide, or narrow they wanted to go was a crucial step before starting working on our deliverables. We solved this together with the client by giving them three different options, called Creative Directions.                                         <p>

                                    Each proposed direction contained a draft of a Brand Narrative, a Brand Principle, Pros / Cons, and a short summery on 'How to make it work'. This was valuable for both our team to get a overview of the potential in the different approaches, but also for our client to understand that design for everyone is to design for no one.
                                                                </p>

                                    For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob . After we had jogged on for some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way . It was a large long room with some large maps in it . I doubt if I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and I cast away in the middle of them . I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair. For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob . After we had jogged on for some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going.
